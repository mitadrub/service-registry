# service-registry
***********************************************
When we have multiple microservices it is difficult to manage. So we want something that can manage all the microservices. And also if we want to scale them up in the future we need some service for that.
This service-registry will maintain all the microservices and also enable us scaling of the microservices.
All the microservices will be connected to the service-registry and we will get all the information like status update, port information, url everything from there.
